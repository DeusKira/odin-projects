                    “Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar, 
                    but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. “

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cream together the butter & sugar until smooth; beat in the egg yolks. Blend in the dissolved hartshorn or baking soda, then the zest, salt & spices. Stir in the flour and work until a ball of dough is formed. Knead gently until smooth, working in more flour if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 1/4 ” thickness. With a floured butter knife, cut the dough into small squares or rectangles. Make decorative vent holes on the cakes by pricking with a fork, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in a preheated 300° F oven for 14-15 minutes until just done. Be sure that they do not brown on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack.  While they are cooling, mix the lemon juice and honey together in a pan on the stove, over low heat.  Let cool slightly before brushing onto cakes, and store in an air-tight container.
